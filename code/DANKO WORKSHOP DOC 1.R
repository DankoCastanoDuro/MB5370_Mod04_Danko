#DATA
mpg
#Create your first ggplot
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#PLAYING WITH PLOTS
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class)) #looks great

#PLAYING with plots 2.0
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) 
#looks very shitty playing with sizes, donâ€™t plot a variable which is not continuous to a continuous aesthetic like size

#ALPHA PLAYS WITH TRANSPARENCY
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

#SHAPE CAN ALSO BE CHANGED
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

#YOU CAN ALSO DECIDE THE COLOR
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

#QUESTION

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy),colour = displ < 5)

#colour = displ < 5: This sets the color of the points based on a condition. 
#Points where the 'displacement' variable is less than 5 will have one color, and points where the 'displacement' variable is greater than or equal to 5 will have another color.


#COMMON ERRORS 
ggplot(data = mpg)
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# the + should be on top line

#FACETS AND PANEL PLOTS
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
#SPLITS DATA PER CLASS OF CARS (NOTS X & Y) EX: TYPES OF CARS PER DISPLAY AND HWY

#If you want to do this with more than one variable, then use facet_grid().
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)


#Exercise:
#1. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options
#control the layout of the individual panels?

#`nrow` and `ncol` in `facet_wrap` control the grid layout of panels in a faceted plot. `nrow` sets the number of rows, while `ncol` sets the number of columns. Other options like `dir`, `as.table`, and `shrink` adjust panel arrangement and scale size.
